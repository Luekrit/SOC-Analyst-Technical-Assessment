# 🛡️ SOC Analyst – SIEM Alert Analysis Template

A reusable template for documenting SIEM alerts in a structured and standardized format.

---

## 1. SIEM Alert Analysis

This section is used to document how a SOC analyst receives, triages, and investigates alerts generated by a SIEM or other security tools.  
It provides a structured way to record **what fired**, **why it fired**, **how it was validated**, and **what actions were taken**.

Use this template for each incident or lab scenario to ensure consistency and repeatability in your investigations.

---

### 1.1 Alert Summary

Use this table to provide a **high-level overview** of all alerts related to the incident.  
Each row represents one alert or detection event that you are analyzing as part of the case.

| Alert ID | Alert Title | Description | TP/FP | Category | Asset | Initial Action | Priority |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|----------|
|          |             |             |       |          |        |                |          |
|          |             |             |       |          |        |                |          |

**Field Guidance:**

- **Alert ID** – Use the SIEM alert ID, ticket number, or create your own reference (e.g., A1, A2, A3).
- **Alert Title** – The title from the SIEM rule or detection (e.g., “Multiple Failed Logins Followed by Success”).
- **Description** – Short summary of what the alert is about.
- **TP/FP** – Mark as `True Positive (TP)`, `False Positive (FP)`, or `Needs More Analysis`.
- **Category** – e.g., Brute Force, Malware, Phishing, Data Exfiltration, Policy Violation, Reconnaissance.
- **Asset** – The primary affected system or user (e.g., `FINANCE-WS01`, `DC01`, `user@company.com`).
- **Initial Action** – First response step (e.g., triage, escalation, dismiss, auto-block).
- **Priority** – `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, or `Critical` based on potential impact and urgency.

> Tip: Start by filling this summary table **before** going into deep analysis. It gives you a quick view of all alerts in scope.

---

### 1.2 Detailed Alert Investigation

Use this section to **deep dive into each alert** from the summary table.  
You can repeat this block for each alert (`Alert A1`, `Alert A2`, etc.).

#### 1.2.1 Basic Alert Information

**Alert ID:**  
*(Match the ID from the summary table, e.g., A1, A2, or the SIEM’s native ID)*  

**Alert Title:**  
*(Exact rule/detection name from SIEM/EDR, e.g., “Suspicious RDP Login from External IP”)*  

**Source:**  
*(SIEM / EDR / Firewall / CloudTrail / Email Gateway / IDS / Proxy / Other)*  

**Detection Source Details (Optional):**
- **Platform / Tool:** (e.g., Splunk, Wazuh, Microsoft Sentinel, CrowdStrike, etc.)
- **Rule / Use Case Name:** (e.g., `RDP Brute Force`, `Privilege Escalation Behavior`, `Mass Download from File Share`)
- **Rule ID / Signature ID:** (if available)
- **Severity as Reported by Tool:** (Low / Medium / High / Critical)

**Description:**  
Provide a short human-readable description of what this alert means.  
> Example: “This alert fires when more than 10 failed RDP logon attempts are followed by a successful login from the same external IP within 5 minutes.”

---

#### 1.2.2 Key Indicators

Capture the most important indicators observed for this alert.

- **Source IP:**  
- **Destination IP:**  
- **Source Port (if relevant):**  
- **Destination Port (if relevant):**  
- **Username / Account Involved:**  
- **Host / Endpoint Name:**  
- **Event ID(s) / Signature(s):**  
  - e.g., Windows Event ID 4625, 4624, 4688; IDS signature ID; EDR alert ID, etc.
- **Timestamps (Start / End):**  
  - First observed:  
  - Last observed:  

**Additional Context (Optional):**
- **GeoIP Info (if internet-facing):** Country / Region of Source IP  
- **Reputation Info:** Is the IP/domain known as malicious (from threat intel)?  
- **Asset Criticality:** Is the target system high value (DC, database, finance, HR)?  

---

#### 1.2.3 Context & Environment

Explain the **environment** where the alert occurred. This helps justify whether the behavior is normal or suspicious.

- **User Role:** (e.g., Finance user, IT admin, Developer, Service Account)
- **Host Role:** (e.g., File server, domain controller, web server, end-user laptop)
- **Known Usage Pattern:**  
  - Does this user typically log in from this location/IP?  
  - Does this server usually receive this type of traffic?  
- **Recent Changes:**  
  - Any recent deployments, patches, configuration changes, or maintenance that may explain the alert?

---

#### 1.2.4 Analysis

Provide a **short narrative** (3–5 sentences) explaining:

- Why the alert triggered  
- What you investigated (logs, tools, queries)  
- Whether the activity appears legitimate or malicious  
- Any patterns, anomalies, or suspicious behavior found  

**Example structure:**

> The SIEM generated an alert for multiple failed RDP logins followed by a successful login from an external IP. I reviewed Windows Security logs (Event IDs 4625 and 4624) on the targeted host and confirmed that the successful login originated from an IP associated with a foreign ISP not normally used by this user. No prior successful logins were observed from this IP. The behavior aligns with a potential brute force or credential stuffing attempt, and is considered truly suspicious.

You can also break this down into bullet points:

- **What triggered the alert:**  
- **What logs were reviewed:**  
- **What stood out as suspicious or benign:**  
- **Any link to other alerts or incidents:**  

---

#### 1.2.5 Validation Steps

Record exactly **what you checked** to validate or refute the alert.

**Example checklist:**

- [ ] Queried host logs (Windows Event Logs / Syslog)  
- [ ] Checked EDR/AV telemetry for malware or suspicious processes  
- [ ] Reviewed firewall / VPN / proxy logs for related network activity  
- [ ] Checked for known malicious IPs/domains via threat intelligence  
- [ ] Verified user activity (e.g., confirmed with user or HR)  
- [ ] Checked for persistence mechanisms (registry keys, scheduled tasks, etc.)  
- [ ] Searched SIEM for similar activity on other hosts/users  

You can also include specific queries used (Splunk SPL, KQL, etc.) in a later **Evidence** section.

---

#### 1.2.6 Determination (True Positive / False Positive)

Clearly state the outcome:

- **Classification:** `True Positive` / `False Positive` / `Benign True Positive` / `Needs More Analysis`  
- **Reasoning:**  
  - Summarize why you consider it TP/FP.  
  - Mention key evidence (e.g., unusual geo, off-hours login, known malware, or known maintenance).  

**Example:**

> **Classification:** True Positive  
> **Reason:** The login originated from an untrusted external IP, outside normal working hours, and the user confirmed they did not initiate the connection. Additional suspicious PowerShell commands were observed shortly after login. This behavior indicates unauthorized access and is treated as a security incident.

---

#### 1.2.7 Immediate Actions Taken

Document what you did **as a result of this alert**.

**Examples of actions:**

- Disabled or locked user account  
- Forced password reset  
- Isolated affected endpoint from network (via EDR or manually)  
- Blocked source IP at firewall or WAF  
- Opened an incident ticket / escalated to Tier 2 / IR team  
- Collected forensic artifacts (memory dump, logs, file copies)  
- Notified stakeholder (manager, system owner, affected user)  

You can use a bullet list:

**Immediate Actions Taken:**
-  
-  
-  

---

#### 1.2.8 Priority & Recommended Next Steps

Assign a **final priority** based on your investigation and recommend what should happen next.

**Priority:** `Low` / `Medium` / `High` / `Critical`  

**Recommended Next Steps:**

- Further log analysis on related systems  
- Threat hunting for similar patterns across environment  
- Patch or configuration changes  
- Playbook updates or rule tuning in SIEM  
- User awareness or training follow-up  
- IR escalation or post-incident review  

> Example:  
> **Priority:** High  
> **Next Steps:** Hunt for similar RDP login patterns from the same IP range, reset all potentially compromised credentials, and update SIEM rules to trigger earlier on similar behavior.

---

## 2. Log Analysis & Threat Hunting

This section documents how a SOC analyst reviews logs, correlates multi-source telemetry, identifies attacker behaviors, and validates or refutes suspicious activity.  
It provides a structured methodology for examining **endpoint logs, authentication records, network events, cloud audit logs, and EDR telemetry**.

Use this section to build a complete picture of adversary actions, confirm alert accuracy, and identify patterns or malicious sequences.

---

### 2.1 Suspicious Event Log Table

Record all key suspicious events discovered across log sources.  
Each row should capture a **single suspicious event**, mapped to its log source and basic details.

| Timestamp (UTC) | Log Source | Event ID / Type | Description | User / IP / Host |
|------------------|------------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
|                  |            |                  |              |                   |
|                  |            |                  |              |                   |
|                  |            |                  |              |                   |

**Field Guidance:**

- **Timestamp:** Use UTC timestamps for consistency across SIEM/EDR/firewall logs.  
- **Log Source:** Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, EDR, Firewall, CloudTrail, Azure Sign-In Logs, Email Security, etc.  
- **Event ID / Type:**  
  - Windows: 4624, 4625, 4688, 7045  
  - Sysmon: 1, 3, 7, 11  
  - Cloud: IAM role assumption, MFA change, API call  
  - EDR: Malware alert, credential dump detection  
- **Description:** Short summary of what the event indicates.  
- **User / IP / Host:** Identify affected accounts, endpoints, and remote IP sources.

---

### 2.2 Inquiry-Based Threat Hunting Questions

Use these questions to guide deep-dive log analysis:

#### **Authentication & Identity**
- Were there repeated failed logins before a successful one?  
- Did any login originate from unusual countries, ISPs, or devices?  
- Did a service account authenticate interactively (which is abnormal)?  
- Did privileged accounts authenticate outside normal hours?

#### **Endpoint Behavior**
- Were suspicious processes spawned (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `wmic.exe`)?  
- Did any unsigned binary or LOLBin execute (e.g., `certutil`, `rundll32`)?  
- Did processes spawn with parent-child relationships that are unusual?

#### **Network Activity**
- Are there unusual outbound connections to unknown IPs/domains?  
- Is there unexpected SMB traffic between workstations?  
- Any signs of lateral movement (RDP, SMB, WMI, WinRM, SSH)?

#### **Cloud Activity**
- Were new IAM roles created or modified?  
- Any MFA disabled/enrollment changes?  
- Suspicious API calls (e.g., mass S3 access, privilege escalation)?

#### **File System & Persistence**
- Were new scheduled tasks created?  
- Registry Run keys modified?  
- Files dropped in suspicious folders (Temp, Public, Startup)?

These questions guide what logs you need to check next.

---

### 2.3 Multi-Source Log Correlation

Here you correlate events across log types to build a unified narrative.

**Example correlation chain:**

- **Firewall Log:** External IP → RDP connection attempt  
- **Windows Log (4624):** Successful interactive login  
- **Sysmon Log (Event 1):** PowerShell spawned  
- **Sysmon Log (Event 3):** Outbound connection to malicious domain  
- **EDR Alert:** Credential dumping detected  
- **File Server Logs:** User accessed sensitive SMB shares  

**Guidance for filling this section:**

- Identify **cause-and-effect relationships** (e.g., “Login → Process Execution → Lateral Movement”).  
- Use timeline ordering for clarity.  
- Highlight unexpected behavior (administrator commands run by non-admin users, unknown parent processes, etc.).  
- Note indicators that support escalation (privilege escalation → lateral movement → collection → exfiltration).  

Provide a paragraph explanation:

> Example Template:  
> Log analysis indicates that the attacker authenticated into FINANCE-WS01 via RDP using compromised credentials. Shortly after, Sysmon recorded unusual PowerShell execution followed by network scanning activity. The attacker attempted access to multiple SMB network shares, followed by credential dumping behavior detected by the EDR agent. This pattern indicates lateral movement attempts and possible data harvesting.

---

### 2.4 Endpoint Log Analysis (Windows / Linux)

Break down endpoint behavior into categories.

#### **Process Execution (Windows: Event 4688 / Sysmon Event 1)**
Document any suspicious process activity.

| Timestamp | Process | Parent Process | Command Line | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------------|----------------|-------|
|          |          |                |                |       |

Watch for:
- PowerShell with encoded commands  
- LOLBins (certutil, mshta, regsvr32, wscript, rundll32)  
- Credential tools (mimikatz, lsassy, secretsdump)  

#### **Authentication Logs (Windows: 4624, 4625)**
Track successful and failed logins, logon types, and unusual IPs.

#### **Persistence Artifacts**
Look for:
- Registry Run keys  
- Scheduled tasks  
- WMI permanent event subscriptions  
- Startup folder artifacts  

#### **Linux Logs**
Check:
- `/var/log/auth.log`  
- `/var/log/syslog`  
- Suspicious cron jobs  
- SSH logins from unknown IPs  

---

### 2.5 Network Log Analysis

Analyze network-level activity for lateral movement, scanning, C2, and data transfer.

**Key network logs to check:**

- Firewall logs  
- Zeek logs (`conn.log`, `dns.log`, `http.log`, `smb.log`)  
- Cloud VPC Flow Logs  
- VPN authentication logs  

**Indicators to track:**
- RDP (3389), SMB (445), WinRM (5985), SSH (22)  
- DNS patterns (DGA domains, unusual subdomains)  
- Long-duration outbound connections  
- Large data transfers off-premises  

**Network Flow Table:**

| Timestamp | Source → Destination | Protocol | Port | Action | Notes |
|-----------|------------------------|----------|------|--------|-------|
|           |                        |          |      |        |       |

---

### 2.6 Email & Phishing Log Analysis (If Applicable)

If phishing was part of the incident:

Check:
- Email headers  
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC status  
- URL sandbox verdicts  
- Attachment scans  
- User click activity  

Table:

| User | Email Subject | Sender Domain | Verdict | Notes |
|------|----------------|----------------|---------|-------|
|      |                |                |         |       |

---

### 2.7 Cloud Log Analysis (AWS / Azure / GCP)

Examples of suspicious events:

#### AWS:
- IAM `AssumeRole` from unknown IP  
- Access key usage outside normal hours  
- Mass S3 object retrieval  
- Deletion of CloudTrail logs  

#### Azure:
- Impossible travel sign-in  
- Risky sign-in detections  
- Consent to malicious OAuth apps  
- MFA disabled  

#### GCP:
- IAM role modifications  
- Audit log tampering  
- External API token usage  

---

### 2.8 Summary of Findings (Narrative)

Write a **clear summary** of what log analysis revealed.

> Example:  
> Log analysis confirms the attacker used compromised credentials to authenticate via RDP. Endpoint logs show immediate PowerShell execution followed by credential dumping. Network telemetry revealed SMB enumeration across several hosts, suggesting attempted lateral movement. No data exfiltration was detected, but access to internal file shares occurred. Logs support this as a targeted credential-based intrusion requiring containment.

This summary bridges the logs with the **MITRE ATT&CK mapping** in Section 3.

---

## 3. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

This section maps all observed (or potential) adversary behaviors to the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework.  
Mapping behaviors to ATT&CK helps analysts understand:

- What stage of the attack lifecycle occurred  
- Which techniques were used  
- What the attacker’s goals may have been  
- How to strengthen detection, response, and prevention controls  

The mapping includes **tactics**, **techniques**, **sub-techniques**, and specific event observations gathered during log analysis.

---

### 3.4 Narrative Summary (Analyst Interpretation)

Provide a concise explanation of the mapped behaviors.

> Example Narrative:  
> The attacker gained initial access using compromised credentials (T1078), followed by remote execution of PowerShell commands (T1059.001). Sysmon logs indicate lateral movement attempts via SMB and RDP (T1021.001/T1021.002). EDR telemetry captured attempts to dump credentials from LSASS (T1003). Evidence of reconnaissance activity (T1082/T1046) suggests preparation for broader movement. No verified exfiltration was confirmed, but multiple techniques align with early-stage intrusion progression.

---

### 3.5 Defensive Gaps & Opportunities

Document improvement areas related to detection coverage.

- Missing Sysmon logs for credential dumping  
- No alert for encoded PowerShell commands  
- Weak MFA enforcement enabling use of Valid Accounts  
- SMB lateral movement not properly monitored  
- Cloud environment lacked risky sign-in alerting  

---

### 3.6 ATT&CK Navigator JSON (Optional)

You can export your technique list into **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator** for visualization:  
https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/

---

## 4. Incident Response Actions

This section documents how the incident was contained, what Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) were discovered, and how the attack unfolded over time.  
Use it to maintain a clear, repeatable record of your response steps for each incident.

---

### 4.1 Initial Containment

Describe all **immediate actions** taken to stop or slow down the attack once detected.

**Checklist (tick or update as applicable):**

- [ ] Isolated compromised hosts from the network (e.g., removed from domain, blocked VLAN, disabled NIC)
- [ ] Disabled or locked compromised user accounts
- [ ] Blocked malicious IP addresses at firewall / WAF / security gateway
- [ ] Blocked malicious domains and URLs at DNS / proxy / secure web gateway
- [ ] Stopped or killed malicious processes on endpoints
- [ ] Quarantined or deleted known malicious files
- [ ] Disabled risky services or protocols (e.g., SMBv1, external RDP)
- [ ] Revoked API keys, tokens, or sessions involved in the incident
- [ ] Captured volatile data before shutdown (memory, network connections, running processes)
- [ ] Notified internal stakeholders (IT, management, compliance, etc.)
- [ ] Escalated to incident commander / CSIRT if required

**Containment Summary (free text):**

> _Example:_ Immediately after detecting suspicious RDP activity, the affected workstation was isolated from the network using EDR network containment. The `john.smith` account was disabled in Active Directory, and the source IP `198.51.100.73` was blocked at the perimeter firewall. Known malicious binaries identified by EDR were quarantined for further analysis.

---

### 4.2 Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

Document all **known IOCs** that can be used for detection, hunting, and blocking.  
Group them by type (file, network, user/access, registry, etc.).

#### 4.2.1 File-Based IOCs

| File Name                  | Path / Location                     | Hash (MD5 / SHA256)                         | Behavior / Description                              |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|

### 4.3 Attack Timeline

The attack timeline provides a chronological breakdown of the adversary’s actions from the initial compromise to containment and remediation.  
A precise timeline helps analysts understand attacker dwell time, technique progression, pivoting behavior, and the impact of SOC response actions.

Use **actual log timestamps (UTC)** from SIEM, EDR, Windows Event Logs, firewall logs, email gateways, cloud logs, or proxy logs.

| Time (UTC)          | Event / Phase                     | Details                                                                                     |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM    | **Initial Access**                 | e.g., Phishing email delivered to user; malicious link clicked; exposed credentials stolen |
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM    | **Execution**                      | e.g., User executed `invoice_payment.pdf.exe` triggering initial malware payload            |
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM    | **Privilege Escalation**           | e.g., Attacker executed Mimikatz to obtain local admin or domain admin privileges           |
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM    | **Lateral Movement**               | e.g., SMB connections initiated to `\\10.10.15.5\c$` and other internal network shares      |
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM    | **Data Collection / Exfiltration** | e.g., Large outbound HTTPS transfer to unknown external IP (if applicable)                  |
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM    | **Detection**                      | e.g., SIEM alert triggered for unusual RDP activity / credential dumping behavior           |
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM    | **Containment**                    | e.g., Endpoint isolated, accounts disabled, firewall block applied                          |
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM    | **Recovery / Remediation Start**   | e.g., Systems reimaged, passwords reset, patches applied, logs reviewed                    |

#### Guidance:
- Always convert timestamps to **UTC** for consistency.
- Cross-reference timestamps across logs:
  - Windows Security logs → Logon Type 10 (RDP)
  - Sysmon logs → process creation (4688)
  - Firewall logs → inbound/outbound traffic
  - EDR telemetry → credential dumping, persistence
  - Email logs → phishing delivery timestamps
- A detailed timeline helps identify:
  - Dwell time  
  - Lateral movement paths  
  - Privilege escalation vectors  
  - SOC detection response time  
  - Whether the attacker performed reconnaissance or exfiltration

> **Guidance:**  
> - Always correlate timestamps with host logs (Windows, EDR) and SIEM alerts.  
> - Use PCAP only when necessary; prefer metadata logs to reduce storage and privacy risks.

### 8.5 Malware / Suspicious File Evidence

This subsection documents **malicious or suspicious files** discovered during the investigation. These can include droppers, payloads, tools, or scripts.

#### ⚠️ Safety Warning (For Public Repos)

If using GitHub (especially public):

- Do **NOT** upload live malware directly.
- If absolutely required for educational labs:
  - Sanitize or obfuscate samples where possible.
  - Compress archives using a password (commonly `infected`).
  - Clearly label the content as **malware** or **test payload**.
- Alternatively, **only reference hashes and filenames**, without distributing the files.

#### 8.5.1 File Evidence Template

Use this table to track malware or suspicious files:

| File Name                | Description                          | Location                  | Hash (SHA256)                       |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `mimikatz.exe`           | Credential dumping tool              | `/evidence/malware/`      |                                     |
| `invoice_payment.pdf.exe`| Malicious phishing attachment payload| `/evidence/malware/`      |                                     |
| `dropper.bin`            | Secondary dropper / loader           | `/evidence/malware/`      |                                     |

> **Guidance:**  
> - Compute **SHA256 hashes** using tools like `sha256sum`, `Get-FileHash`, or EDR output.  
> - If working in a lab, note whether malware behavior was observed in a sandbox (e.g., Any.Run, FlareVM, etc.).  
> - For each file, consider also documenting:
>   - How it was delivered (phishing, drive-by download, RDP)  
>   - Whether AV/EDR detected it  
>   - Whether it established persistence

### 8.6 Registry, Scheduled Tasks & Persistence Artifacts

This subsection focuses on **persistence mechanisms** used by the attacker or malware to survive reboots or maintain long-term access.

#### 8.6.1 Common Persistence Techniques

Examples to look for:

- **Registry-based autostart entries**
  - `Run` and `RunOnce` keys
  - Shell or UserInit Hijacking
- **Scheduled tasks / cron jobs**
  - Tasks executing scripts or binaries periodically
- **WMI persistence**
  - Event consumers and filters
- **Startup folder artifacts**
  - Executables, scripts, or shortcuts in startup directories

#### 8.6.2 Example Persistence Evidence Table

| Evidence Type  | Path / Details                                                      | Description                               |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Registry Key   | `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\backdoor`       | Persistence executable launched at logon  |
| Scheduled Task | `Task Name: updater.exe` – triggers `C:\Tools\updater.exe` hourly   | Executes malicious binary every hour      |
| Startup Folder | `C:\Users\Public\start.exe`                                         | Dropper placed in public startup location |

> **Guidance:**  
> - Capture **before/after** state where possible (e.g., reg export).  
> - Use Sysmon, Autoruns, or forensic tools to detect new persistence points.  
> - Always correlate persistence artifacts with process execution logs and timestamps.

### 8.7 Email Evidence (If Applicable)

If the incident involved **phishing, business email compromise, or malware via email**, this subsection records all email-based evidence.

#### 8.7.1 Types of Email Evidence

- Raw email files (`.eml`, `.msg`) – sanitized for lab use
- Email headers (full headers for routing, SPF, DKIM, DMARC analysis)
- Suspicious attachments and links
- Sender address and spoofed domains
- Delivery time and user interaction timeline

#### 8.7.2 Example Email Evidence Table

| File / Reference                          | Description                           |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `/evidence/email/phishing_email.eml`      | Original phishing email               |
| `/evidence/email/header.txt`              | Full email header for analysis        |
| `/evidence/email/attachment_name.txt`     | Metadata or extracted text of payload |

> **Guidance:**  
> - Analyze headers to see **SPF/DKIM/DMARC** status and mail relay path.  
> - Identify if domain is newly registered or suspicious.  
> - Map which users received and interacted with the email.

### 8.8 Cloud Evidence (Optional)

If cloud resources were involved (AWS, Azure, GCP, SaaS), this subsection documents **cloud-specific evidence**.

#### 8.8.1 Common Cloud Evidence Types

- **IAM Logs** – role assumptions, policy changes, key usage  
- **Audit Logs**
  - AWS CloudTrail
  - Azure Activity Logs / Sign-In Logs
  - GCP Cloud Audit Logs
- **MFA Configuration Changes**
- **Suspicious API Calls**
  - Unusual geographic patterns
  - Abnormal services or actions
- **Cloud Storage Activity**
  - S3 bucket access logs
  - Blob storage reads/writes

#### 8.8.2 Example Cloud Evidence Table

| Cloud Provider | Evidence File                               | Description                                     |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| AWS            | `/evidence/aws/cloudtrail_logs.json`         | Unauthorized `AssumeRole` attempts              |
| Azure          | `/evidence/azure/signin_logs.csv`            | Impossible travel login patterns for admin user |

> **Guidance:**  
> - Always correlate cloud logs with identity activity (e.g., Okta, Entra ID, local AD).  
> - Look for role escalations, API calls from unusual IP ranges, or access from unexpected countries.

### 8.9 Chain of Custody (Optional but Professional)

This subsection is essential for **formal incident response, legal cases, or forensic-grade investigations**.  
It documents **who collected what**, **when**, and **how it was stored**, ensuring **integrity and admissibility** of evidence.

#### 8.9.1 Chain of Custody Table

| Evidence Item                    | Collected By     | Date & Time (UTC)   | Storage Location                               | Integrity Verified (Y/N) |
|----------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `/evidence/network/rdp_traffic.pcap` | L. Analyst       | 2025-03-07 09:14 UTC | Secured share: `\\ir-server\evidence\network` | Y                         |
| `/evidence/malware/invoice_payment.pdf.exe` | M. Forensics | 2025-03-07 09:32 UTC | Offline disk: `IR-Drive-01`                   | Y                         |

> **Guidance:**  
> - Use hashing (e.g., SHA256) to verify evidence integrity over time.  
> - Note every transfer of evidence between analysts, systems, or storage locations.  
> - For a portfolio, you can simulate chain-of-custody for realism (no real PII).
