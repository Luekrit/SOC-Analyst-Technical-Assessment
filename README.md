# üß© SOC Analyst Technical Assessment (Learning Template)

## üìò Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to perform end-to-end SOC analysis ‚Äî from SIEM alert triage and log correlation to MITRE ATT&CK mapping and incident response reporting.  
The assessment simulates a **ransomware attack** delivered through a phishing campaign, requiring log analysis, threat hunting, and response planning.

---

## üß† Part 1 ‚Äì SIEM Alert Analysis
Analyzed 5 alerts to identify true vs false positives:
- **Brute Force Attack (Critical)** ‚Äì multiple failed DB logins from 203.0.113.42  
- **Phishing Email Malware Detection (High)** ‚Äì malicious emails from `supplierxyz-invoices.com`  
- Applied prioritization to focus on high-impact events.

---

## üïµÔ∏è Part 2 ‚Äì Log Analysis & Threat Hunting
- Detected **RDP connection from external IP (198.51.100.73)** using compromised credentials.  
- Observed **Mimikatz execution** for privilege escalation (`SeDebugPrivilege`).  
- Correlated events across **Firewall, Windows, and EDR logs** to trace lateral movement and data exfiltration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Stage | Technique | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Initial Access | T1078 | Valid Accounts (RDP login) |
| Execution | T1059 | Command-Line Execution |
| Privilege Escalation | T1068 | Exploitation of Privilege Escalation |
| Credential Access | T1003 | Credential Dumping (Mimikatz) |
| Lateral Movement | T1021 | Remote Services (SMB) |
| Exfiltration | T1048 | Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol |

## üö® Part 3 ‚Äì Incident Response
- Contained the spread by **disabling SMB traffic** and isolating infected hosts.  
- Identified **IOCs:** `.locked` file extension, `invoice_payment.pdf.exe` payload, `.onion` URLs.  
- Recommended **account disablement, password resets, and MFA enforcement.**

---

## üßæ Part 4 ‚Äì Executive Summary
At 04:30 AM, multiple employees reported file access issues.  
Investigation confirmed a **ransomware attack via phishing email** leading to SMB propagation and encryption.  
Immediate containment actions were taken, and long-term improvements such as **EDR deployment, phishing awareness, and network segmentation** were proposed.
